        <h4 class="block-header">Our story</h4>

        <p>
          In May 2001 a Porsche hung from a crane in Berlin with the message
          “Cash or Crash?!” – In just one week, around 100k mobile phone users
          voted via text whether the cash value of the Porsche should be raffled
          or the car should be dropped. Finally, it fell to a depth of more than
          50 meters. We realized the power of mobile and how you could reach out
          and engage with people. That’s when YOC – ‘Your Opinion Counts’ – was
          born. Back then this slogan was describing YOC’s business: Reaching
          people on their mobile devices and providing them with the
          information, they were really interested in. Not much has changed
          since then. Our vision remains reaching people on their most personal
          device, entertaining them and generating a desire for new products and
          brands. Technology has changed rapidly however and YOC has
          successfully progressed and evolved every step of the way: Best
          mobile-first advertising is what still drives us to develop new
          products and solutions every day.
